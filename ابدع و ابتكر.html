                        The 2019-20 (1) coronavirus pandemic or the Covid-19 pandemic, also known as the Coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of MERS-CoV-19, caused by MERS-CoV-2. The disease first broke out in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019.
                        The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the outbreak on 30 January as a public health emergency of international concern,
                        and confirmed the outbreak's transformation into a pandemic on March 11th. More than 85.6 million
                        cases of COFD-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and regions as of January 5, 2021, including more than 1, 850, 000 deaths, and more than 48 million have recovered. The United States is the country
                        most affected by the pandemic, with more than a quarter of the total number of confirmed infections.

                        The virus is transmitted primarily in close contact between individuals, often through spray and respiratory droplets resulting from coughing,
                        sneezing or talking. Droplets usually fall on the ground or on surfaces without moving through the air over long distances. In a less common context,
                        individuals may become infected by touching the eyes,
                        mouth or nose after touching a surface contaminated with the virus.
                        The susceptibility to infection peaks within the first three days after symptoms appear,
                        with the possibility of transmission before it appears through non-accidental patients.
                        Common symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and loss of olfactory and taste. The list of complications may include both pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
                        The time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms ranges from 2 to 14 days,
                        with an average of five days. There is still no effective vaccine or viral treatment against the new CORONA virus, and the disease is limited to treating symptoms with supportive treatment.

                        ...Most people with Coved-19 are recovering. For those who do not recover, the duration between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, usually about 14 days. As of May 14, 2020, approximately 297, 000 deaths have been returned to Coved-19. As of February 5, about 80% of deaths were recorded in those over 60 years of age, 75% of whom suffered from pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

                        The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020. The first death outside China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.

                        Official deaths from Coved-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive results in accordance with protocols. This may ignore the deaths of people who die untested, for example at home or in nursing homes. On the contrary, the deaths of people with latent conditions may lead to excessive censuses. Comparing mortality statistics for all causes versus seasonal average indicates an increase in mortality in many countries. In the most affected areas, the mortality rate was several times higher than the average. In New York City, deaths were four times higher than the average, twice as high in Paris, and in many European countries, deaths were on average 20 to 30% higher than normal. These excess deaths may include deaths due to stress from health care systems and discontinuation of elective (cold) surgeries.<br /> <br />

                            Several measures are used to determine mortality. These figures vary by region and are influenced over time by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options and duration since the initial outbreak, as well as the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and public health. Some countries (e.g. Belgium) are due to suspected cases of Cofed-19, regardless of whether the person has been tested, resulting in a higher number of cases compared to countries with only confirmed test cases.

                            The death rate for the case reflects the number of deaths attributed to Coved-19 divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time. According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate per case is 6.8% (297,682 deaths for 4,371,611) as of May 14, 2020. The number varies by region.

                            Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who have died of an illness, and the rate of infection death (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease. These statistics do not have time limits and track a specific population of infection. The OrWorld In Data center states that as of March 25, 2020, IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total number of deaths is known. In February, the Institute for Disease Modelling estimated the IFR rate at 0.94% (95% confidence interval 0.37-2.9), based on data from China. Oxford University's Evidence-Based Medical Centre estimated the global CFR rate at 0.82% and IFR from 0.1% to 0.41%, recognizing that this would vary among the population due to differences in demographics....

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reports sent by China's health authorities to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, indicate a combination of diseases of the same unexplained viral lung in the city of Wuhan, in Khobe iprovince, and an investigation began in early January 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared on January 30th that the outbreak of the virus is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), with 7,818 cases confirmed worldwide on the same day, across 19 countries in five of the six WHO regions.

                    Animal origin of the virus is believed to be associated with most early cases of Wuhan seafood market for wholesale. The virus responsible for the outbreak is known as SARS-Kov-2, a newly discovered virus closely associated with coronaviruses found in bats, coronaviruses found in squamous ant eaters, and coronavirus type I associated with acute acute respiratory syndrome. The scientific consensus currently remains on the natural origin of Coved-19.

                    The first symptom swelled on December 1, 2019, and no clear links were found between the patient and the subsequent patient pool at wuhan wet seafood market, while evidence was found linking two-thirds of the patient grouping reported this month to the market. The South China Morning Post reported on March 13, 2020, of a case dating back to November 17, 2019 (a 55-year-old man from Khobi) who may have been the first to be infected with the CORONA virus. The information contained in the report remains unconfirmed.

                    The World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged that the Coved-19 outbreak turned into a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan reported a rise in the number of infections, with the total number of infections outside China rapidly exceeding those in China.

                        Five million infected a year. 600, 000 deaths. And billions spent trying to stop it, but this isn’t the novel coronavirus (branded COVID-19). That’s your average seasonal flu. Every year new strains of flu pop up, require a new vaccine to be made, and kill a lot of people in the process, so why are we so freaked out about coronavirus when it isn’t even one fifth as bad as the average flu?

                        Many people have taken this logic as a reason to not be worried about COVID-19, and to a certain extent they’re right. COVID-19 will probably pass into the same historical footnote as SARS, Bird Flu, and Swine Flu, but that doesn’t mean it’s time to take off that face mask, touch your face, and never wash your hands again (it should actually never mean that last one).[article id=5086]It doesn’t help that we hear so many conflicting levels of worry being expressed from experts in the field. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic and Dr. Richard Hatchett, the lead researcher on the international team developing the vaccine has called it the scariest illness he’s seen in 20 years, comparing our global fight against COVID-19 to a war, right before asking for $2 billion in research funds; can we really trust either to tell us how bad, or how manageable the illness is?

                        So, we made a list to compare COVID-19 to the seasonal flu, so you can see if you’re freaking out too much or not freaking out enough.

                        Infectious Rate

                        We have dealt with the flu for centuries, if not millennia, and that has given us a genetic response to flu that naturally slows it down.

                        According to Oxford University research, 5 people with flu on average will spread it to 45 other people in the course of the disease cycle of inflection (the time between getting it and being cured). Researcher say COVID-19 will spread to 368 people in the same time period.[article id=5114]It’s much more contagious than SARS for instance, according to the WHO, SARS inflected less than 25, 000 people in its history. That number was surpassed in the first 40 days of the new COVID-19 outbreak alone.

                        However, the high spread rate depends on our healthcare systems. The WHO has said that countries with a centralized healthcare system like South Korea were more prepared to deal with this virus than a country like the United States which depends on private systems that do not coordinate, have few connections to other hospitals, and do not depend on the government.

                        Mortality Rate

                        COVID-19 has a higher death rate than the flu. So far, COVID-19 kills 1%-3.4% based on the country’s response (less than 1% in South Korea after the government mandated state wide testing, 3.4% in Iran as the country is suffering from international sanctions that makes it hard to get medical gloves, much less testing tools).

                        But that could be because people who have serious symptoms go to the hospitals, where they are confirmed with the illness, rather than those who have a mild form of COVID-19 and just stay home.

                        “It’s easier to miss mild cases that resolve by themselves than it is to miss dead people, ” said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.

                        But 1% in far more than the 0.1% death rate of the seasonal flu.

                        A Longer Waiting Period

                        The time between when you have the virus and the time when you actually start to have symptoms is called the virus’s incubation period, viruses with a longer incubation period spread more. How can you prevent yourself from infecting people if you don’t even know you have the virus? The flu shows symptoms after 1 day, COVID-19 shows symptoms after 5 days, sometimes up to two weeks.

                        This is why people travel to Egypt, thinking they are fine, but then find themselves sick much later, or develop symptoms after they have already traveled to multiple countries.

                        International travel has been the means of the virus’s spread across the world. Because economies are so linked, and business with China takes place with every country of the world, this spread the illness as it waits inside a person presenting no symptoms at first.

                        Vaccine

                        Seasonal flu vaccines are ready almost as soon as researchers know which strain of the flu they are dealing with that year; all it needs is a few tweaks to the previous flu strain’s vaccine.

                        COVID-19 is a bit different, but researchers already understand the various proteins and DNA that the virus is composed of. This helps them make a vaccine that targets the virus, to prevent its spread. It also doesn't hurt that governments are spending billions to try and assure the public that they are doing everything they can to combat the disease. Probably money spent on COVID-19 that could have been spent on a better target, but when national people's panic, governments have to do something to avoid a backlash.

                        Many companies, including the National Research Center in Egypt are working on the vaccine. While most vaccines take up to 6 months to be ready, most of these companies and institutions have announced it shouldn’t take longer than 3 to 4 months for a vaccine to COVID-19 to meet the illness.[article id=5132]Depending on the response by governments, we might not even need it. By the time we made a vaccine to SARS and Zika, the virus had already been contained. As Italy, Iran, and China work to get a handle on their large scale outbreaks, let’s hope that we also will not need a vaccine by the time the virus is contained, isolated, and eliminated by old-fashioned quarantines, testing, and preventive measures.

                        So will COVID-19 spread to 2/3 of the world population, killing millions and wreaking havoc like Dr. Hatchett has prophesized? Or is our panic of something new that we don’t understand the only real crisis we are dealing with like the WHO has warned? Only time will tell how serious governments take the situation, how long it takes for a vaccine to come out, and how much our worry clouds rationality.
                        <br> The numbers of the Covid-19 confirmed cases and deaths are increasing in the whole world I hope we can be safe and take care of ourselves, and you can see the NO. of confirmed cases and deathes from this link, and <b> Thank you.</b>
